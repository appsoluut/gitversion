# Setup a demo repository

In order to run the getting started tutorial you can also just set an empty local repo just for testing

Run the following commands to set-up an empty repo

```sh
# Lets start with a fresh folder
$ mkdir test-gitversion
$ cd test-gitversion

# Init a new local repository with the default branch "main"
$ git init --initial-branch=main

# Init a new workspace
$ npm init -f
```
