# 0.x.x releases

## Commit rules

Releases in the 0.x.x range are special in semantic versioning.

From [semver.org](https://semver.org) they mention this:

::: info
Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.
:::

Gitversion will start with version 0.0.0 and with will follow standard conventional commmits with the following rules:

Bump type:
- MAJOR: 0.0.0 => 0.1.0
- MINOR: 0.0.0 => 0.0.1
- PATCH: 0.0.0 => 0.0.1

Therefor a 0.x.x version can't move to 1.0.0 with common commits.

## Graduating to 1.0.0

In to order to graduate a 0.x.x version to 1.0.0 you have to make this explicit with the specified bump type:

```sh 
$ gitversion bump --bump-type=GRADUATE
```

After graduation gitversion will follow the standard commits with the following rules:

Bump type:
- MAJOR: 1.0.0 => 2.0.0
- MINOR: 1.0.0 => 1.1.0
- PATCH: 1.0.0 => 1.0.1

The GRADUATE type will still work but will act the same as MAJOR
